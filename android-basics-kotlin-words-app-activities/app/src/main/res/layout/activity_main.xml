<!--
    b/c layouts are now contained in fragment_letter_list.xml and fragment_word_list.xml,
    the activity_main.xml file no longer needs to contain the layout for first screen in app.
    Instead, MainActivity will be repurposed to contain a FragmentContainerView to act as
    the NavHost for the fragments.
-->

<!-- setting android:name to NavHostFragment allows FragmentContainerView to navigate between fragments -->
<!-- app:defaultNavHost="true"
    this allows fragment container to interact with the navigation hierarchy
        ex: if systems back button is pressed, the container will navigate back to previously shown fragment..
            ..just like what happens when a new activity is presented -->

<!-- app:navGraph="@navigation/nav_graph"
    this points to an xml file that defines how your app's fragments can navigate to one another -->

<!-- since the two attributes above were added to the app namespace,
        need to add xmlns:app attribute to the FrameLayout -->
